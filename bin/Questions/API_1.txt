01.What is API ? 
enables two applications to communicate with each other. it comprimise a number of
of subroutine definition , logs , and tools for creating application software.

Google maps , Twitter API , 

customer and kitchen , api is the waiter.

02.Different between API and WebService ? 

All Web Services as API , but not all API are web Services 
API are accessible from the network

Web Services might not contain all the specifications and cannot perform all the
task that API would perform

create a method and put in to a web url then it becomes Web Services.
Webservices need only URL , different parameter , Execution of internal business logic
execute by API


Web Services are uses : SOAP , REST , XML-RPC
API expose to multiple ways

03. What are the limits of API usage ?
Many API have certain limit set up by provider , estimate your usage and understand 
how that will impact the overall cost of the offering.


04. What are some architectural styles for creating a Web API?

HTTP for client server communication
XML / JSON as Formatting language : Java systems to dot net Systems communicate
Simple URI as the address for the services

05. Who can use Web API ?
Can be consume by any client which support HTTP verb such as GET , PUT , DELETE , POST
 
06. What is API Testing ? 
 Kind of a testing that determines if the developed  APIs meet 	expectations regarding 
 the functionality , reliability , performance , and secuity of the application
 
 07. What are the advantages of API Testing ? 
 
 Test for Core functionality / Time Effective / Language Independent (java, c# , python) /
 Easy integration with GUI
 
 08. Some common protocols used in API Testing ? 
 JMS , REST , HTTP , UDDI & SOAP
 
 09. What is the test enviorament of API ? 
 Consider DB & Server (qa , dev , prod) , maintaining config for each enviorament
 
 10. What are the principle of an API test design ? 
 Setup (create object , start services , initialize data)
 Execution (steps to apply API , scenario)
 Verification (oracles to evaluate the result of the execution)
 Reporting (pass , fail or blocked)
 Clean up (pre test state)
 
 11. What are the common API testing types ? 
 Validation , Functional , UI , Load , Run Time / Error detection , Security , 
 Penetration , Fuzz , Interopatibility and WS Compliance testing
 
 12. What is the procedure to perform API Test ? 
 Choose the suite to add the API tc
 Choose the test enviorament mode
 Demand the development of tc for the required API methods 
 Configure the control parameters of the application and then test conditions 
 Configure method validation
 Execute the api test 
 Check test reports and filter API tc
 Arrange all API test case
 
 13. What must be checked when performing API testing ? 
 Accuracy of Data / Schema Validation 
 HTTP Status code (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status )
 / Data type , validation , order and completeness
 Authorization checks 
 Implementation of response timeout 
 Error codes in cas API returns 
 
 14. What is the approach method to perform API Testing ? 
 Defining the correct input parameter
 Verifying the calls of the mixture of two or more added value parameters 
 Defining the basic functionality and scope of the API program
 Write relevant API tc's , equuilance class , boundary value , to check the operatability 
 Tc's execution
