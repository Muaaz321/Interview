16. What are the difference between API and Unit testing ?

Api Test											Unit Test
------------										---------------
1#Conduct by QA Team								Conduct by Dev Team
2#Mostly black box test								White box test
3#Aimed to access the full functionality			Used to verify each unit in isolation performs as expected or not
of the system for it will be employed 
by end user / external dev
4#Often run after the build and authors             Each of the code modules must be ensured to pass the unit test before being built by dev
do not have access to the source code

17. API and UI difference ? 

communicate between two systems - API
UX , Layout , images - UI

18. Major challenges faced in API Test ?

Parameter Selection
Parameter Combination
Call Sequence 
Output validation and verification

19. Common API errors that often founded ? 

Missing module / Documentation error / Parameter validation error / standard error (negative data)

20. API Documentation ? 
Swagger / mireDot API / RestDoc 

21. When writing API document , what must be considered ?

Source of the content 
Document plan or Sketch 
Delivery layout 
Information needed for every function in the doc
Automatic document creation programs


22. What is REST ? 

Representation State Transfer is a architectual style for developing web services which exploit
the ubiquity of HTTP protocol and uses HTTP method to defined actions.

23. What is Restful Web Services ? 
2 kind of web services 

SOAP / RestFul

24. Some characteristic on REST

Stateful tracks information about the state of a connection or application, 
while stateless does not. Stateless and stateful protocols are fundamentally different from each other. 

A stateless system sends a request to the server and relays the response (or the state) back without storing 
any information

25. Components of HTTP Request ? 
	
	HTTP Methods : GET , PUT , POST , DELETE
	URI
	HTTP version
	Request Header , Key and value pair
	Request Body , payload
	
26. PUT vs PATCH

PUT , new information will update along with entire object
PATCH , only new information will update , others will not update

27. OPTIONS is used to describe the communication options for the target resource
	GET , POST , PUT , DELETE examples

	28. Schema validation
